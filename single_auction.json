This yam mythology is central to Emily Kngwarreye\u2019s custodial responsibilities for her country called Alalgura on Utopia Station.Emily Kngwarreye completes a canvas in one session. The \u201cstory\u201d is applied onto a prepared black canvas, and is viewed as a seemingly unregulated and spontaneous manner of expression, often concentrating on one area, and occasionally allowing an abandoned outburst.The dotwork indicates through her main colours, red and yellow, that summer rains have fallen. In her layered approach, we see the sporadic clustered growth of plants in different stages of maturity. Understanding the life cycle of these plants is vital to survival in the bush, as is understanding the human life cycle and its needs. This knowledge is affirmed within the narrative of the song cycle sung in ceremony. Ceremony, or \u201cawelye\u201d, recognises the spiritual power that maintains nature\u2019s fertility and hardness, and celebrates this to ensure the survival of future generations.\u2019",

The billabong at Milmilngkan is where Ngalyod \u2013 the rainbow serpent \u2013 resides under the water.Kuninjku people say there are two Rainbow serpents. One is Yingarna who is said to have been the original creator of all ancestral beings, the \u2018first mother\u2019. Yingarna\u2019s first born is the Rainbow serpent called Ngalyod. Yingarna \u2013 the rainbow serpent \u2013 or her son Ngalyod are common subject on contemporary Kuninjku bark paintings.Ngalyod is very important in Kuninjku cosmology and is associated with the creation of all sacred sites,djang, in Kuninjku clan lands. For example, ancestral stories relate\u00a0how creators or ancestral beings had travelled across the country and had angered Ngalyod who swallowed them and returned to the earth to create the site. Today, Ngalyod protects these sites and its power is present in each one. Ngalyod has both powers of creation and destruction and is most strongly associated with rain, monsoon seasons and rainbows which are a manifestation of Ngalyod\u2019s power and presence. Ngalyod is associated with the destructive power of the storms and with plenty of the wet season, being both a destroyer and a giver of life. Ngalyod\u2019s power controls the fertility of the country and the seasons.John Mawurndjul lives at Milmilngkan near this billabong and says that underneath the water lies the power of Ngalyod. In this painting, he depicts the power of the place withrarrk\u2013 cross-hatching \u2013 which contains Mardayin power.\u2019",
