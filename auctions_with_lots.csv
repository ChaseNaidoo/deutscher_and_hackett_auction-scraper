The “story” is applied onto a prepared black canvas, and is viewed as a seemingly unregulated and spontaneous manner of expression, often concentrating on one area, and occasionally allowing an abandoned outburst.The dotwork indicates through her main colours, red and yellow, that summer rains have fallen. In her layered approach, we see the sporadic clustered growth of plants in different stages of maturity. Understanding the life cycle of these plants is vital to survival in the bush, as is understanding the human life cycle and its needs. This knowledge is affirmed within the narrative of the song cycle sung in ceremony. Ceremony, or “awelye”, recognises the spiritual power that maintains nature’s fertility and hardness, and celebrates this to ensure the survival of future generations.’",Not specified,"$165,682 (",https://www.deutscherandhackett.com/auction/lot/yam-flowers-1994,https://www.deutscherandhackett.com/81-important-australian-indigenous-art

Yingarna – the rainbow serpent – or her son Ngalyod are common subject on contemporary Kuninjku bark paintings.Ngalyod is very important in Kuninjku cosmology and is associated with the creation of all sacred sites,djang, in Kuninjku clan lands. For example, ancestral stories relate how creators or ancestral beings had travelled across the country and had angered Ngalyod who swallowed them and returned to the earth to create the site. Today, Ngalyod protects these sites and its power is present in each one. Ngalyod has both powers of creation and destruction and is most strongly associated with rain, monsoon seasons and rainbows which are a manifestation of Ngalyod’s power and presence. Ngalyod is associated with the destructive power of the storms and with plenty of the wet season, being both a destroyer and a giver of life. Ngalyod’s power controls the fertility of the country and the seasons.John Mawurndjul lives at Milmilngkan near this billabong and says that underneath the water lies the power of Ngalyod.

She lived nomadically as part of a clan group with a flotilla of canoes between Groote Eyelandt and the mainland. Her father's name was Mundukul (lightning snake) and this is also the name of the serpent (also known as Water Python, Burrut'tji or Liasis Fuscus) which lives deep beneath the sea here. Some of the designs show the rock set in deep water between the electric 'curse' that the snake spits into the sky in the form of lightning, and the spray of the sea trying to shift the rock foundation of the Madarrpa. Yurr'yunna is the word used to describe the rough waves over-topping the rock and the spray flying into the sky. This journey from the sacred to the descriptive shifts even further where she uses her mark making to portray more anonymous natural features of her landscape such as drying billabongs in the flood-plains of cracking mud. Her identity cannot be separated from her art and so although she disavows any sacred intent the echo of miny'tji persists.'",Not specified,"$9,818 (",https://www.deutscherandhackett.com/auction/lot/baratjala-2015,https://www.deutscherandhackett.com/77-important-australian-indigenous-art

Traditionally, Angeline (sometimes called Angelina) and her older sisters, Polly and Kathleen, would cover their upper bodies with emu oil; using ochre paints they would be decorated with specific designs related to the wild plum (anwekety), then they danced and sang (awelye) the story of the anwekety as a vital part of nature's cycle, to ensure the profundity and continued productivity of this valuable food source.

In this painting, he depicts the power of the place withrarrk-cross-hatching which contains Mardayin power.John Mawurndjul has depicted Milmilngkan place where Ngalyod - the rainbow serpent - resides under the water. Kuninjku people say there are two Rainbow serpents. One is Yingarna who is said to have been the original creator of all ancestral beings, the 'first mother'. Yingarna's first born is a Rainbow serpent called Ngaloyd. Yingama - the Rainbow serpent - or her son Ngalyod are common subject on contemporary Kuninjku bark paintings.Ngalyod is very important in Kuninjku cosmology and is associated with the creation of all sacred sites,djang, in Kuninjku clan lands. For example, ancestral stories relate how creator or ancestral beings had travelled across the country and had angered Ngalyod who swallowed them and returned to the earth to create the site. Today, Ngalyod protects these sites and its power is present in each one.Ngalyod has both powers of creation and destruction and is most strongly associated with rain, monsoon seasons and rainbows which are a manifestation of Ngalyod's power and presence. Ngalyod is associated with the destructive power of the storms and with the plenty of the wet season, being both a destroyer and a giver of life.

Characteristics of the Rainbow Serpent vary greatly from group to group, also depending on the site. Often viewed as a female generative figure, the Rainbow Serpent can sometimes also be male. She has both powers of creation and destruction and is most strongly associated with rain, monsoon seasons and of course the colours seen in rainbows which all across the sky like a giant serpent. For Aboriginal people in Northern Australia, the rainbow serpent is said too be active during the wet season.Often she is associated with billabongs and freshwater springs where she resides and she is responsible for the production of most water plants such as water lilies, water vines and palms which grow near water. The circles in the tail and surrounding the serpent represent manbark 'water lilies' and are symbolic of this power. The roar of the waterfalls in the escarpment country is said to be her voice. Large hills and cliff faces are said to be her tacks. she is held in awe because of her apparent ability to renew her life by shedding her skin. Aboriginal myths about the Rainbow Serpent often describe her as a fearful creature who swallows human only to regurgitate them. The white ochre used by the artist to create the brilliant white paint for body paintings, body decoration and in the past rock art, is said to be the faeces of the Rainbow Serpent.Aboriginal people today respect sacred sites where the Rainbow Serpent is said to reside. Often certain activities are forbidden at these places for fear that the wrath of the great snake will cause sickness.’",Not specified,"$6,750 (",https://www.deutscherandhackett.com/auction/lot/ngalyod-rainbow-serpent-1999,https://www.deutscherandhackett.com/68-important-australian-aboriginal-art

The carved and elaborately decorated figures became an integral part of Tiwi ceremony and are used to represent tribal ancestors from the Dreamtime. The isolation of the Tiwi people from the mainland also contributed to the development of a unique art style which differed distinctly from that of mainland aboriginals.This female figure represents Bima or Wai-ee, the unfaithful wide of Purukapali, who in the Dreamtime decreed that all Tiwi should die after discovering the death of his son and his wife’s unfaithfulness. Because of her remorse, Bima then turned into the Curlew who roams the forest at night wailing in remorse for her mistakes and for the child she tragically lost.’",Not specified,"$9,573 (",https://www.deutscherandhackett.com/auction/lot/double-sided-janus-figure-bimawai-ee-c1964,https://www.deutscherandhackett.com/68-important-australian-aboriginal-art

Her focus is a seasonal one, her painting conveying the dramatic colours of abundance within in the arid lands of north-east of Alice Springs. Kngwarreye leans into her canvas and builds up a landscape loaded with various plums, berries, flowers and seeds, as a celebration of replenishment of her country, and a reminder that colour is a vital indicator of ripeness and availability to harvest. We feel her connection to this surface and linking into those special places where these fruits and seed are located, and of past experiences of being there.’",Not specified,"$104,318 (",https://www.deutscherandhackett.com/auction/lot/untitled-1994-0,https://www.deutscherandhackett.com/63-important-australian-aboriginal-art

The elder sister is able to carry bigger firewood than the younger sister who can only carry small firewood. In the olden days these two sisters used to be people, but they turned into stars that sit in the sky under the Milky Way. The second story is about seven sisters who went out in their canoe called Djulpan. During certain seasons they go hunting for food and always come back with different types of food. They come back with turtle, fish, freshwater snakes and also bush foods like yams and berries. They can be seen in the sky of a night, seven stars that come out together. The stars come in the season when the food and berries come out; the stars will travel through the sky during that month until the season is over and they don't come out until the next season.’",Not specified,"$39,040 (",https://www.deutscherandhackett.com/auction/lot/garak-larrakitj-2011,https://www.deutscherandhackett.com/60-important-australian-aboriginal-art
